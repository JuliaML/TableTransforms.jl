Some of their transforms such as MeanStdScaling are constructed for a specific table and cannot be inserted in the middle of a pipeline for example.\nAutoMLPipeline.jl relies on the Python stack via PyCall.jl. They provide pipelines with Julia's pipe |> operator and follow a more \"Pythonic\" interface. They do not support general Tables.jl.\nImpute.jl, Cleaner.jl, DataConvenience.jl all have a small set of transforms related to fixing column names as well as other basic transforms that we plan to absorb in the long term.\nDataFramesMeta.jl is a package to manipulate DataFrames.jl tables. It is not intended for statistical transforms such as PCA, Quantile, etc, which rely on complex interactions between the rows and columns of a table. The usage of macros in the package promotes one-shot scripts as opposed to general pipelines that can be passed around to different places in the program.\nQuery.jl is a package to query IterableTables.jl. Similar to other alternatives above, the package is not intended for advanced statistical transforms.\nMLJ.jl is one of the most popular packages for machine learning in Julia. The package provides a facility for readily creating non-branching pipelines which can include supervised learners, as well as the flexibility to create more complicated composite machine learning models using so-called learning networks. These composites have the advantage that the hyper-parameters of the component models appear as nested fields of the composite, which is useful in hyper-parameter optimization.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = TableTransforms","category":"page"},{"location":"#TableTransforms.jl","page":"Home","title":"TableTransforms.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Transforms and pipelines with tabular data.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Overview","page":"Home","title":"Overview","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This package provides transforms that are commonly used in statistics and machine learning.

Similar to the :VD transform, but the data is projected back to the basis of the original variables using the Vᵀ matrix.\n\nSee https://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/sphereingmaf for more details about these three variants of eigenanalysis.\n\nExamples\n\nEigenAnalysis(:V)\nEigenAnalysis(:VD)\nEigenAnalysis(:VDV)\nEigenAnalysis(:V, maxdim=3)\nEigenAnalysis(:VD, pratio=0.99)\nEigenAnalysis(:VDV, maxdim=3, pratio=0.99)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#PCA","page":"Built-in","title":"PCA","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/","page":"Built-in","title":"Built-in","text":"PCA","category":"page"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#TableTransforms.PCA","page":"Built-in","title":"TableTransforms.PCA","text":"PCA(; maxdim=nothing, pratio=1.0)\n\nThe PCA transform is a shortcut for ZScore() → EigenAnalysis(:V; maxdim, pratio).\n\nSee also: ZScore, EigenAnalysis.\n\nExamples\n\nPCA(maxdim=2)\nPCA(pratio=0.86)\nPCA(maxdim=2, pratio=0.86)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#DRS","page":"Built-in","title":"DRS","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/","page":"Built-in","title":"Built-in","text":"DRS","category":"page"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#TableTransforms.DRS","page":"Built-in","title":"TableTransforms.DRS","text":"DRS(; maxdim=nothing, pratio=1.0)\n\nThe DRS transform is a shortcut for ZScore() → EigenAnalysis(:VD; maxdim, pratio).\n\nSee also: ZScore, EigenAnalysis.\n\nExamples\n\nDRS(maxdim=3)\nDRS(pratio=0.87)\nDRS(maxdim=3, pratio=0.87)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#SDS","page":"Built-in","title":"SDS","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/","page":"Built-in","title":"Built-in","text":"SDS","category":"page"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#TableTransforms.SDS","page":"Built-in","title":"TableTransforms.SDS","text":"SDS(; maxdim=nothing, pratio=1.0)\n\nThe SDS transform is a shortcut for ZScore() → EigenAnalysis(:VDV; maxdim, pratio).\n\nSee also: ZScore, EigenAnalysis.\n\nExamples\n\nSDS()\nSDS(maxdim=4)\nSDS(pratio=0.88)\nSDS(maxdim=4, pratio=0.88)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#Sequential","page":"Built-in","title":"Sequential","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/","page":"Built-in","title":"Built-in","text":"Sequential","category":"page"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#TableTransforms.Sequential","page":"Built-in","title":"TableTransforms.Sequential","text":"Sequential(transforms)\n\nA transform where transforms are applied in sequence.\n\nExamples\n\nScale(low=0.2, high=0.8) → EigenAnalysis(:VDV)\nSelect(:x, :z) → ZScore() → EigenAnalysis(:V) → Scale(low=0, high=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#Parallel","page":"Built-in","title":"Parallel","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/","page":"Built-in","title":"Built-in","text":"Parallel","category":"page"},{"location":"transforms/builtin/#TableTransforms.Parallel","page":"Built-in","title":"TableTransforms.Parallel","text":"Parallel(transforms)\n\nA transform where transforms are applied in parallel.\n\nExamples\n\nScale(low=0.3, high=0.6) ⊔ EigenAnalysis(:VDV)\nZScore() ⊔ EigenAnalysis(:V)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
